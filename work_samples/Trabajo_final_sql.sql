SET 1 Question 2
Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares to the duration that all
movies are rented for. Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter,
third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories?
Make sure to also indicate the category that these family-friendly movies fall into.

Check Your Solution
The data are not very spread out to create a very fun looking solution, but you should see something like the following if
you correctly split your data. You should only need the category, film_category, and film tables to answer this and the next questions.
