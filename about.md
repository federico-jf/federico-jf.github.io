Strong experience with Learning Theories of Sociocultural tradition, Learning and Academic Analytics, and Educational Technology. I have training in qualitative research (Grounded Theory and Ethnographic procedures) as well as quantitative research building SQL queries and using Python and R programming languages in regression models, data visualization, GIS, and data mining.
