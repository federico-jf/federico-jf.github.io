*I have worked in educational research as a Doctoral and Postdoctoral Fellow at CONICET (Argentina), focusing on teaching, developing, and delivering content for higher-education students in online and blended-learning environments. I have a strong background in psychometrics and educational measurement, along with experience in learning theories from the sociocultural tradition, learning and academic analytics, and educational technology. I am trained in both qualitative research methods (Grounded Theory and ethnographic approaches) and quantitative research, including psychometric modeling, regression analysis, data visualization, GIS, and data mining, using SQL, Python, and R. During my years in Argentina, I participated in international research initiatives and institutional strengthening projects involving digital technologies. I am a passionate, tech-savvy learner with a strong interest in humanistic discussions about technology. Currently, I work as a Data Analyst (Program Evaluation) at Dallas Independent School District.*
